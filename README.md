# CST-452
Repository for Senior Project 




This game is my senior project for Grand Canyon University. 
User will need to download the latest version PyCharm Community Edition.
User will need to download or copy/paste git repository when launching a new Python project. 

Once the game is installed, run the application and using the keyboard, hit enter on the "Start" menu pop-up. 
The application will run and the user will have to use the directional buttons on the keyboard to move Pacman. 

As of 2022/07/02 there isn't any bugs/glitches that I am aware of. 
Below is the code diagrams and Pacman source code.
